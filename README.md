## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-project.git
   cd ml-project
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:

- Modify the dataset or hyperparameters as needed to explore different scenarios.

## 🤖 Example Machine Learning Model
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model accuracy
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## 📝 To-Do
- Implement additional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks).
- Perform advanced feature engineering.
- Automate hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.
